        Iâ€™m <b>Bruna Prauchner</b>.
        Born in Porto Alegre (Brazil) and raised in a small town
        called Eldorado do Sul. I studied <b>Computer Science</b> at PUCRS.
        At the beginning of university I wanted to study english abroad
        to enhance my communication skills thus I went to Australia.
        I arrived on the other side of the world completely alone
        that made me realize everyday has a surprise it can be good or bad
        we have to know how to deal with both sides of the coin.
        <b> Going out of your comfort zone</b> is an addictive feeling
        and to put that in practice when I came back I decided
        to do volunteer work, since I`m addicted to <b>experiences
            that can broaden my horizons. </b>
        Fast-forward to today I work as <b>Software Engineer</b> at DELL
        in a multicultural team to delivers innovative payment solutions,
        allowing organizations to align and scale the cost of IT solutions
        with technology consumption and budget availability.

        Is the best way to <b>select a film to watch</b>.
        The game is based on the <b>artificial intelligence</b> created
        by three friends. Gina will asks a series of questions
        and then return a list of movies based on your answers.
        Here we are not generating a list based in movies genres like
        'Best drama movies 2019', here
        the selection is based on
        "Would you like to watch movies with ..."
        human-dog relationships? lots of action on screen?
        snow and rain? technology and futuristic stuff?
        located on the beach with a brighter sun?

        <b> AI - Automated planning. </b>
        The goal is to save runaway giraffes from the Madagascar ZOO.
        <b> The domain consists of locals, agents and giraffes. </b>
        Giraffes are only saved with the help of agents and they go through different danger situations: Drowning; Getting lost in the woods; Fire. Agents can perform certain functions: Lifeguard; Rescuer; Fireman; Caretaker. With the domain implemented, problem files were created, with increasing difficulty, to evaluate the
        <b> scalability of the planner used. </b>
        For a better visualization, a
        <b> graphical interface </b>
        was developed using
        <b> Unity </b>
        in order to animate the solution of the problems, since the solution that the planners return can become overwhelming to understand.

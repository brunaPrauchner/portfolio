        I’m <b>Bruna Prauchner</b>.
        originally from Brazil and currently living in <b>Vancouver, Canada</b>. 
        My major is <b>Computer Science</b> and I’m doing a post graduate course in Software engineer.
        Living abroad taught me the importance of embracing both positive and negative surprises 
        in life. Stepping out of my comfort zone has become an addiction, 
        leading me to engage in <b>volunteer work</b> to expand my horizons. 
        I began my career as a Software Engineer at <b>DELL</b>, working in a multicultural 
        team that develops innovative payment solutions. Also worked as a 
        Senior Software Engineer at <b>ADP</b>, contributing to the Wisely® ecosystem in the payments industry,
        conducting technical interviews to evaluate candidates and assisted in onboarding and training of new team
        members.
        I created this webpage to present my work, share my knowledge, and personal interests
        and <b>inspire other women in tech</b>.
        <b> Enjoy.</b>&#127811;

        An <b>Artificial Intelligence</b> based project created by three friends
        that aims to help users to find the best movies
        or things to watch based on what their tastes and feelings are right now.
        Here we are not generating a list based on movies genres like
        'Best drama movies 2019', here the selection is based on
        "Would you like to watch movies with ..." human-dog relationships?
        lots of action on screen? snow and rain? technology and futuristic stuff?
        located on the beach with a brighter sun? <b>
            Created with C# .NetCore along with React,
            using the <a href='https://imdb-api.com/api' target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" >IMDB API</a> to query movies.

        <b> AI - Automated planning. </b>
        The goal is to save runaway giraffes from the Madagascar ZOO.
        <b> The domain consists of locals, agents and giraffes. </b>
        Giraffes are only saved with the help of agents and they go through different danger situations: Drowning; Getting lost in the woods; Fire. Agents can perform certain functions: Lifeguard; Rescuer; Fireman; Caretaker. With the domain implemented, problem files were created, with increasing difficulty, to evaluate the
        <b> scalability of the planner used. </b>
        For a better visualization, a
        <b> graphical interface </b>
        was developed using
        <b> Unity </b>
        in order to animate the solution of the problems, since the solution that the planners return can become overwhelming to understand.

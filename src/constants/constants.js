        Iâ€™m <b>Bruna Prauchner</b>.
        Born in Porto Alegre (Brazil) and raised in a small town
        called Eldorado do Sul. I studied <b>Computer Science</b> at PUCRS.
        At the beginning of university I wanted to study english abroad
        to enhance my communication skills thus I went to Australia.
        I arrived on the other side of the world completely alone
        that made me realize everyday has a surprise it can be good or bad
        we have to know how to deal with both sides of the coin.
        <b> Going out of your comfort zone</b> is an addictive feeling
        and to put that in practice when I came back I decided
        to do volunteer work, since I`m addicted to <b>experiences
            that can broaden my horizons. </b>
        Fast-forward to today I work as <b>Software Engineer</b> at DELL
        in a multicultural team to delivers innovative payment solutions,
        allowing organizations to align and scale the cost of IT solutions
        with technology consumption and budget availability.
        Here I'm experiencing <b>pair programming, TDD,</b> and other agile engineering practices.
        I created this webpage to present my work, share my knowledge, personal interests
        and to <b>inspire other women in tech</b>.
        <b> Enjoy.</b>&#127811;

        An <b>Artificial Intelligence</b> based project created by three friends
        that aims to help users to find the best movies
        or things to watch based on what their tastes and feelings are right now.
        Here we are not generating a list based on movies genres like
        'Best drama movies 2019', here the selection is based on
        "Would you like to watch movies with ..." human-dog relationships?
        lots of action on screen? snow and rain? technology and futuristic stuff?
        located on the beach with a brighter sun? <b>
            Created with C# .NetCore along with React,
            using the <a href='https://imdb-api.com/api' >IMDB API</a> to query movies.

        <b> AI - Automated planning. </b>
        The goal is to save runaway giraffes from the Madagascar ZOO.
        <b> The domain consists of locals, agents and giraffes. </b>
        Giraffes are only saved with the help of agents and they go through different danger situations: Drowning; Getting lost in the woods; Fire. Agents can perform certain functions: Lifeguard; Rescuer; Fireman; Caretaker. With the domain implemented, problem files were created, with increasing difficulty, to evaluate the
        <b> scalability of the planner used. </b>
        For a better visualization, a
        <b> graphical interface </b>
        was developed using
        <b> Unity </b>
        in order to animate the solution of the problems, since the solution that the planners return can become overwhelming to understand.

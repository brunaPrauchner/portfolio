    P2: 'AI - Automated planning. The goal is to save runaway giraffes from the Madagascar ZOO. The domain consists of locals, agents and giraffes. Giraffes are only saved with the help of agents and they go through different danger situations: Drowning; Getting lost in the woods; Fire. Agents can perform certain functions: Lifeguard; Rescuer; Fireman; Caretaker. With the domain implemented, problem files were created, with increasing difficulty, to evaluate the scalability of the planner used. For a better visualization, a graphical interface was developed in Unity in order to animate the solution of the problems, since the solution that the planners return can become overwhelming to understand.',
